# Topic Modeling of Survey Responses: Unsupervised Learning With LDA

## Author: Christian Lira Gonzalez  
## Summer 2023  

## Project Overview
This project applies **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** to extract topics from open-ended survey responses. Additionally, **sentiment analysis** and **statistical validation** are performed to assess model stability across multiple simulations.

The main objectives include:
- Automating **topic extraction** from survey responses.
- Performing **sentiment analysis** using **VADER**.
- Evaluating **topic coherence** through **multiple simulations**.
- Conducting **hypothesis testing** to validate model robustness.
- Visualizing **topic distributions, sentiment trends, and statistical measures**.

By leveraging **unsupervised learning**, this project improves the efficiency of survey analysis and enhances decision-making based on textual data.

## Usage

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Cleans survey responses by **removing stopwords, tokenizing, and lemmatizing**.
- Handles missing values.
- Outputs a processed dataset ready for modeling.

Run:
```bash
python src/preprocess_data.py
```

### 2. Topic Modeling (LDA)
- Trains an **LDA model** with varying parameters.
- Identifies dominant **topics per document**.
- Evaluates **coherence scores** to optimize model performance.

Run:
```bash
python src/topic_modeling.py
```

### 3. Sentiment Analysis & Visualization
- Computes **sentiment scores** using **VADER**.
- Generates **word clouds** highlighting key sentiment-driven words.
- Creates **boxplots comparing sentiment scores per topic**.

Run:
```bash
python src/sentiment_analysis.py
```

### 4. Statistical Analysis & Model Validation
- Runs **1000 simulations** with different random configurations of LDA parameters (number of topics, passes, random seeds).
- Computes:
  - **Mean & standard deviation** of coherence and sentiment scores.
  - **95% confidence intervals** to assess stability.
  - **T-tests** for statistical validation.
- Produces **histograms of coherence & sentiment score distributions**.

Run:
```bash
python src/statistical_analysis.py
```

## Results & Insights
### Topic Coherence Scores
- The average coherence score was **0.306**, indicating **moderate topic coherence**.
- Confidence interval: **[0.264, 0.343]**, ensuring model stability.

### Sentiment Scores
- The mean sentiment score was **0.986**, suggesting that responses were **predominantly positive**.
- Confidence interval: **[0.780, 1.000]**, confirming consistency.

### Hypothesis Testing
- **Null Hypothesis:** The coherence score is equal to 0.3.
- **Result:** **p-value â‰ˆ 8.33e-23** (much smaller than 0.05).
- **Conclusion:** Strong evidence against the null hypothesis; coherence is significantly different from 0.3.

## Error Handling & Debugging
- **Missing Values:** Handled before processing.
- **NameError (e.g., 'ldamodel' not defined):** Ensure correct LDA model reference.
- **Statistical Errors:** Ensure sufficient simulation runs for stable estimates.

## Future Enhancements
ðŸš€ **Dynamic topic selection** based on coherence optimization.  
ðŸ“Š **Interactive dashboards** with Streamlit for real-time analysis.  
ðŸ¤– **Deep learning-based topic modeling** (e.g., BERTopic, Transformer models).
